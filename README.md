# Image_Compression_ML_Python

This Project contains the implementation of K-means algorithm to compress the image and other data files.
This Project compresses the Images but you can change the small code in image_compress.py to compress other data files too.
I have not used the pre-implemented algorithm provided by Python toolkit.
I have developed an algorithm myself in this project and trained the model.
For Imformation, K-means algorithm is an unsupervised learning algorithm and used to form clusters.
